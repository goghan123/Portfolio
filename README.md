1. Rafaela: Webpage (frontend & backend) developed for an entrepeneurship. Since this link is a demo, it is not capable of concluding purchases. It was developed with React hosted on GitHub Pages. Also, the whole web is responsive. Some functions may seem redundant but they are meant to minimize the possibility of bugs and information loss while navigating from any subpage to another.
